This "book" serves as supplementary materials for the assigned readings from the
course textbooks for STA238: Probability, Statistics and Data Analysis, Winter 2020
at the University of Toronto, taught by Alison Gibbs and Alex Stringer. The course
textbooks are as follows:

- **[MIPS]** F.M. Dekking, C. Kraaikamp H.P. Lopuha Ìˆa and L.E. Meester (2005). A modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics: Understanding  How  and  Why. Springer-Verlag. This is the primary reference for the course. This book is available in the University of Toronto bookstore. A pdf version of this textbook is freely available  through the University of Toronto library website.

- **[E&R]** M.J. Evans and J.S. Rosenthal (2003). Probability and Statistics: The Science of Uncertainty. W.H. Freeman and Co.Available in pdf here:http://www.utstat.toronto.edu/mikevans/jeffrosenthal.

- **[ISL]** G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie and R. Tibshirani (2013). An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R. Springer. Available in pdf here:http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL

The primary course text is **MIPS**. The other two are included because they contain
certain important sections that **MIPS** is missing; we won't go over them in nearly
as much detail as we will **MIPS**.

These supplementary materials are structured as follows. Each "chapter" corresponds
to a chapter in one of the course texts, usually **MIPS**. You should read the chapter
in the course text **before** reading the supplementary notes, and you should do
both of these things **before** coming to lecture. 

Each chapter of supplementary
notes contains required practice problems from the relevant textbook chapters, which
you should attempt before lecture and then solve in detail after lecture. Also 
do all of the "quick exercises" in **MIPS** and all of the exercises within these
supplementary notes. Answers to selected exercises are available in the back of
**MIPS**.

You can find the code used to create this book [here](https://github.com/awstringer1/sta238-book).
All of the data is stored in the `data` folder in this repository. You can look at
the code for each chapter and copy bits and run them, though of course
we recommend typing them out yourself!
