# Supplement to Chapters 15 and 16

This chapter implements much of the analysis shown in chapters 15 and 16 of 
A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics (MIPS). R code is given for the
simple textbook datasets used in the book, and then the concepts are
illustrated on real data.

All datasets from the book can be downloaded here: https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/applied-mathematics/applied-probability/education/mips/.

The assigned exercises associated with this material are from MIPS, as follows: 15.1, 15.2; 15.5; 15.6; 15.8; 15.11; 15.12
16.1, 16.2; 16.3; 16.4, 16.5; 16.6; 16.8; 16.15. Answers to selected exercises are in the 
back of the book. You should also do all the "quick exercises" within chapters 15 and 16
(solutions are at the end of the chapter). Use `R` as much as possible when answering the
questions.

## Old Faithful

The Old Faithful data is stored in the `oldfaithful.txt` file in the book data
folder. To read it in to `R`, first you need to look at its contents.

### Read in the data

You can either open it in a text editor (since it's small), or print out the
first few lines on the command line. The latter is nicer: the data is printed
properly, without added bits from notepad or whatever; and if you're working with
large data stored in big text files, trying to open the whole thing in an editor
will crash your computer. It's good to get in the habit of working a bit on the
command line now.

If you have
a Mac or Linux-based system, open a terminal. If you have a Windows based system,
get a Mac or Linux. Just kidding (not really though). Download Git Bash: https://git-scm.com/download/win 
and open a new terminal window. 

To look at a text file on the command line, use the `head` command. You have to
tell it where to look on your computer. You can navigate to the folder where the
data is stored and just type the name of the file, or you can type a whole filepath,
or a relative filepath. Right now, I am in the working directory for this book,
and relative to this location, the data is stored in `data/MIPSdata`. 

If you are
not in this directory, you have to navigate there. The `pwd` command tells you
where you are, the `ls -l` command tells you what's there, and the `cd` command
lets you change to a new directory. So if you're in `/home/alex`, you would type
`pwd` and it would print `/home/alex`. If this location contains a folder called
`data`, you can type `ls -l` and there should be a list of stuff, including a folder
called `data`. You can type `cd data` to go there, and repeat the process. Navigate
to where you downloaded the data to-- it's kind of like a game!

Anyways, once you're there, type:

```{bash look-at-oldfaithful-1}
head data/MIPSdata/oldfaithful.txt
```

Don't worry if you don't see the `\#\#`; those are
added by the book. I don't see them when I do this right in the command line.

A column of numbers is printed. This indicates that the text file `oldfaithdful.txt`
contains a single column of numbers, and no header row. A header row is what it's
called when the first row of the dataset contains the names of the columns.

To read such a dataset into `R`, we'll use the `read_csv` function in the `readr`
package. The `readr` package is automatically loaded when we load the `tidyverse`
package. If this sentence is confusing (no worries!) I recommend you check out
[my R tutorial](https://awstringer1.github.io/ssu-r-workshop/ssu-r-workshop.html).

We'll just do that:

```{r read-oldfaithful-1,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
oldfaithful <- readr::read_csv(
  file = "data/MIPSdata/oldfaithful.txt", # Tell it where the file is
  col_names = "time", # Tell it that the first row is NOT column names, and at the same time, tell it what name you want for the column.
  col_types = "n" # Tell it that there is one column, and it is "numeric" (n)
)
# Check what was read in using the dplyr::glimpse() function
dplyr::glimpse(oldfaithful)
```

By `glimpse`ing the data, we see that the format matches what we saw in the raw
file, and we are given the number of rows too. Check that the number of rows matches
what was in the raw file by printing out the number of rows on the command line
using the `wc -l` command ("wc" = "word count" and "-l" means count "lines"):

```{bash look-at-oldfaithful-2}
wc -l data/MIPSdata/oldfaithful.txt
```

What happened, why don't they match? They do. The `wc -l` command actually counts
the number of "newline" characters in the file. It is customary to end a data file
with a newline character. This file doesn't, though. How do I know? Type the following:

```{bash look-at-oldfaithful-3}
tail data/MIPSdata/oldfaithful.txt
```

This prints out the last few lines of the file. In this book, these are printed 
as normal. But if you do it on the command line, you'll see that the command
prompt gets printed on the same line as the final number, `268`. This indicates
that the file does not end with a newline character, and hence the total number
of newlines in the file is `271`, corresponding to `272` actual lines of data.

**Remark**: subtle issues like this come up all the time in data analysis. The
only way to get good at it is practice, so don't be discouraged!

### Graphical Summaries

Now that the data has been read in and checked, we can realize the fruits of 
our labour! Chapter 15 analyzes these data using a tabular display, histogram, kernel density
estimate, and empirical CDF. Here is how to do these things in `R`.

```{r oldfaithful-analysis-1}
# Tabular display
print(oldfaithful$time)
# Ugly! You can use the View() function to open the data in a spreadsheet
# Not run:
# View(oldfaithful)

# Histogram using base R
hist(oldfaithful$time)
# Base R graphics are outdated. Use ggplot2, which is loaded automatically with the tidyverse:
oldfaithful %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..),bins = 30,colour = "black",fill = "blue",alpha = .3) +
  labs(title = "Eruption times for Old Faithful geyser",
       x = "Eruption time",
       y = "Density")

# Try different numbers of bins and you might see different patterns. Do you think this is a
# good or bad thing, or both?
# Their "optimal" bin width:
s <- sd(oldfaithful$time)
n <- nrow(oldfaithful)
b <- (24*sqrt(pi))^(1/3) * s * (n^(-1/3))
b
oldfaithful %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..),bins = round(b),colour = "black",fill = "blue",alpha = .3) +
  labs(title = "Eruption times for Old Faithful geyser",
       subtitle = stringr::str_c("'Optimal' bin width of b = ",round(b)),
       x = "Eruption time",
       y = "Density")

```

To get kernel density estimates, there are a couple different ways. The `density`
function in `R` does the math for you, using a Gaussian kernel (the functions $K_{i}$
are taken to be Gaussian density functions with mean and standard deviation
determined by the data). You can plot the output of `density` using base `R` or
`ggplot`. You can also use the `ggplot` `geom_density` function to do something
similar automatically.

```{r oldfaithfulanalysis-2}
# Kernel density estimation in R
dens <- density(oldfaithful$time)
dens
plot(dens)
# Okay... ggplot?
tibble(x = dens$x,y = dens$y) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x,y = y)) +
  theme_classic() + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Kernel density estimate, Old Faithful data",
       subtitle = "Manually-calculated values",
       x = "Eruption time",
       y = "Density")
# Can also do automatically:
oldfaithful %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) +
  theme_classic() + 
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Kernel density estimate, Old Faithful data",
       subtitle = "Automatically-calculated values",
       x = "Eruption time",
       y = "Density")
# The reason to manually calculate the values is because you have more control.
# I don't know what's happening at the endpoints there, and it's too much work
# to go and figure out how to make ggplot not do that.
# When you calculate the plotting values yourself and then put them into ggplot,
# you have total control!
```

For the empirical distribution function, we use the `ecdf` function in `R`. You
would think this function should behave in a similar manner to the `density` function,
but it doesn't. It returns a function which computes the ecdf. It still has a `plot`
method, but to use it with `ggplot` we have to use `stat_function`:

```{r oldfaithfulanalysis-3}
faithful_ecdf <- ecdf(oldfaithful$time)
plot(faithful_ecdf)
# ggplot
tibble(x = c(100,300)) %>% # Tell ggplot we want to plot the ecdf from 100 to 300
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +
  theme_classic() +
  stat_function(fun = faithful_ecdf) +
  labs(title = "Empirical CDF for Old Faithful Eruption Times",
       x = "Eruption Time",
       y = "Empirical probability that an eruption time is less than x")
```

**Discussion point**: the CDF is the integrated pdf:
$$
F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x}f(s)ds
$$
So why don't we integrate the kernel density estimate to get the empirical CDF?
One of the great benefits of taking a computation-forward approach to statistical
inference is that we can "shoot first and ask questions later"- just try it, and
then (maybe) use math to explain the results.

Here is the world's most naive numerical integration-based estimate of a CDF:

```{r oldfaithfulanalysis-4}
tibble(
  x = dens$x[-1],
  y = cumsum(dens$y[-1]) * diff(dens$x) # Quick and dirty numerical integration. Can you put something better?
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x,y = y)) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Numerical integration-based empirical CDF for Old Faithful data",
       x = "Eruption time",
       y = "Empirical probability that an eruption time is less than x")

```

What do you think? Is this better, worse, or just different than the ECDF?

Chapter 16 discusses boxplots. To get a boxplot, again, you can use base `R` or `ggplot`.
We have:

```{r oldfaithful-boxplot-1}
# Base R
boxplot(oldfaithful$time)
# ggplot
oldfaithful %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = time)) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_boxplot(width = .1) +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of eruption times, Old Faithful data",
       y = "Eruption time") +
  # Have to play around with the x axis to get it to look nice *shrug*
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-.2,.2)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```


### Numerical Summaries (Ch 16)

The numerical summaries in chapter 16 include the sample mean and median, sample
standard deviation and mean absolute deviation, and quantiles.

```{r oldfaithful-numerical-1}
# Mean
mean(oldfaithful$time)
# Median
median(oldfaithful$time)
# Standard deviation
sd(oldfaithful$time)
# Quantiles: tell it which ones you want. I want 0, 25, 50, 75, 100
quantile(oldfaithful$time,probs = c(0,.25,.50,.75,1.00))
# The zeroth and hundredth quantiles are the sample minimum and maximum:
min(oldfaithful$time)
max(oldfaithful$time)
# Actually, you can get all this with the summary() function:
summary(oldfaithful$time)
# Mean absolute deviation
# I don't know an R function for this off the top of my head (maybe you can find one?)
# So let's calculate it manually.
# Actually, let's calculate them ALL manually!
# Mean:
sum(oldfaithful$time) / length(oldfaithful$time)
# Median: it's the 50th percentile
quantile(oldfaithful$time,probs = .5)
# Can get it manually too:
sort(oldfaithful$time)[length(oldfaithful$time)/2]
# Better to use the quantile() function though.
# Standard deviation. Need to save the mean to a variable first:
mn <- mean(oldfaithful$time)
sqrt( sum( (oldfaithful$time - mn)^2 ) / ( length(oldfaithful$time) - 1 ) )
# MAD. Similar to sd:
md <- median(oldfaithful$time)
median( abs(oldfaithful$time - md) )
# IQR:
quantile(oldfaithful$time,probs = .75) - quantile(oldfaithful$time,probs = .25)
# Note that there are various ways to correct for the fact that not all quantiles
# are exact (you may not have a datapoint which has EXACTLY 25% of the data below it,
# like if the sample size isn't divisible by 4). R probably uses a different method
# than the book, so the results here are slightly different.
```

## Drilling

### Read in data

Read in the `drilling.txt` file:

```{bash look-at-drilling-1}
head data/MIPSdata/drilling.txt
```

```{r read-in-drilling-1}
# Use the read_tsv (not csv), because this file is "tab-delimited"; the spaces
# between columns contain tab characters.
drilling <- readr::read_tsv(
  file = "data/MIPSdata/drilling.txt",
  col_names = c("depth","dry","wet"),
  col_types = "nnn"
)
glimpse(drilling)
```

### Graphical summaries

To make a scatterplot, you can again use base `R` or `ggplot`. We want separate plots
for dry and wet holes. You can do this by plotting these data separately, or you
can re-format the data and have `ggplot` do it automatically:

```{r plot-drilling-1}
# Base R
par(mfrow = c(1,2)) # Plots on a 1 x 2 grid
plot(dry~depth,data = drilling)
plot(wet~depth,data = drilling)

# ggplot
# Two separate plots:
dryplt <- drilling %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = depth,y = dry)) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_point(pch = 21) + # pch=21 is the magic command to give you hollow points
  labs(title = "Dry Holes",
       x = "Depth",
       y = "Mean drill time") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(500,1300,by = 200)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(500,1300))
wetplt <- drilling %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = depth,y = wet)) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_point(pch = 21) + # pch=21 is the magic command to give you hollow points
  labs(title = "Wet Holes",
       x = "Depth",
       y = "Mean drill time") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(500,1300,by = 200)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(500,1300))

cowplot::plot_grid(dryplt,wetplt,nrow = 1)

# There is a lot of repeated code here. For a better way to make these two
# plots, first create a base plot object and then reuse it:
drillingplt <- drilling %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = depth)) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Depth",
       y = "Mean drill time") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(500,1300,by = 200)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(500,1300))

dryplt2 <- drillingplt +
  labs(title = "Dry holes") +
  geom_point(aes(y = dry),pch = 21)

wetplt2 <- drillingplt +
  labs(title = "Wet holes") +
  geom_point(aes(y = wet),pch = 21)

cowplot::plot_grid(dryplt2,wetplt2,nrow = 1)

# Much better
# Another option is to reformat the data and create the plot
# with a single command. To do this we stack the dry and wet measurements
# on top of each other, and create a new variable which indicates whether the
# measurements are dry or wet. This is called putting the data into "long" format.
# ggplot then knows how to "facet" the plots according to this new variable.
# Check it out:
drilling_long <- drilling %>%
  tidyr::gather(type,time,dry:wet) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(type = case_when( # Rename the type values for plotting
    type == "dry" ~ "Dry Holes",
    type == "wet" ~ "Wet Holes"
  )) 
dplyr::glimpse(drilling_long)

drilling_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = depth,y = time)) +
  theme_classic() +
  facet_wrap(~type) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mean drilling times",
       x = "Depth",
       y = "Mean drilling time")
# Even though there is more overhead with this method, I recommend it because
# it scales to more variables. If you wanted to make 20 plots, you'd have to 
# have 20 plots in the previous method but here, the code is actually identical.
```

To make boxplots, transform the data in the same way as for the side-by-side
scatterplots, and give to `ggplot`:

```{r plot-drilling-2}
drilling_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = type,y = time)) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplots for wet and dry drilling times, Drilling data",
       x = "Hole Type",
       y = "Mean drilling time")
```

### Numerical summaries

We can compute numerical summaries of drilling times in the same way as for the
eruption times from the Old Faithful data. However, the drilling data are naturally grouped,
so we should compute our summaries by group--- i.e. by hole type, wet or dry.

To do this requires a bit more machinery; we will operate on a dataframe and use
formal grouping operations. This isn't that much harder, but it's really powerful.
Check it out:

```{r drilling-numerical-1}
drilling_long %>%
  group_by(type) %>% # Everything that happens now happens separately for Wet Holes and Dry Holes
  summarize(
    mean = mean(time),
    sd = sd(time),
    min = min(time),
    median = median(time),
    quant_25 = quantile(time,probs = .25),
    quant_75 = quantile(time,probs = .75),
    max = max(time)
  )
```

Grouped operations are fundamental to modern data analysis.

## Exercises

1. The **Janka Hardness** data is in the file `jankahardness.txt`. Reproduce
the analysis in the book yourself.

## Extended example: smoking and age and mortality

You now have some tools. How do you put them to use in practice? Analyzing data
"in the wild" involves a lot of decision making, and this can impact the conclusions
you make.

Consider a famous dataset containing information on smoking and mortality.
The data is available in the `R` package `faraway`. We may load the package and data
and retrieve information on it as follows:
  
```{r load-smoke-1}
# install.packages("faraway") # Run this to install the faraway package, which has useful datasets
library(faraway) # Attach the faraway package
data("femsmoke") # Load the "femsmoke" data
# ?femsmoke # Run this to open the help page for the dataset.
```

We see from the help page, and associated reference to the paper in the *American Statistician*,
that the data comes from asking women in Whickham, England, whether they smoke or not, 
and then following up in 20 years to see if they died.

Let's perform a descriptive analysis of these data. We need some more *quantitative* pieces of descriptive information. What might we want to know about our data? Some ideas:

- How many **observations** are there in the data, and what does an observation represent in the context of how the data was collected?
- How many **variables** are present in the data, and what does each variable represent in the context of how the data was collected?
- How might we summarize each variable? We might compute a **mean** and a **five-number summary** for "continuous" variables, and a **table of counts** for "categorical" variables (more on this later...).

Let's see how we can obtain these descriptive measures in `R`:

```{r descriptive-1}
# Get the number of observations (rows), variables, and an idea
# of what the data looks like:
glimpse(femsmoke)

# One observation represents a count of people in each category.
# How many people?
femsmoke %>%
  summarize(num_people = sum(y)) # The summarize() function lets you compute summaries of variables in your dataframe

# How many smokers?
femsmoke %>%
  filter(smoker == "yes") %>% # filter() lets you choose which rows to keep
  summarize(num_smokers = sum(y))

# How many non-smokers?
femsmoke %>%
  filter(smoker == "no") %>%
  summarize(num_non_smokers = sum(y))

# We can get both those numbers at the same time:
femsmoke %>%
  group_by(smoker) %>% # group_by() makes summarize() compute summaries within levels of a variable
  summarize(num_people = sum(y))
```

There are lots of other descriptive statistics you could calculate.

*Summary*: descriptive analysis involves communicating properties of a dataset, and the context behind the dataset.

### Exercises

1. How many non-smoking 18-24 year olds are there in the `femsmoke` data? Answer using `filter()`.

1. How many smokers died? Answer using `filter()`.

1. How many 45-55 year olds did not die?

1. Compute the following table using `group_by()` and `summarize()`:

```{r descriptive-ex-1,echo = FALSE}
femsmoke %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarize(num_people = sum(y))
```

Let's go into a bit more detail. I want to see if there is any apparent association
between smoking and mortality.

```{r mort-rate-1,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# Compute the mortality rate for smokers and non-smokers.
# To do this, create a dataframe containing the numbers of smokers
# and non-smokers
smoker_numbers <- femsmoke %>% # The %>% operator lets you form sequences of operations
  group_by(smoker) %>% # group_by() makes all the following operations happen within groups
  summarize(num_people = sum(y)) # Count the number of people who are smokers and not smokers 
smoker_numbers

# Now, compute the number of people who died out of the smokers and non-smokers
# This looks the same as above, except we now filter() only the people who died.
smoker_numbers_dead <- femsmoke %>%
  filter(dead == "yes") %>% # Retains rows where dead == "yes" only
  group_by(smoker) %>%
  summarize(num_dead = sum(y))
smoker_numbers_dead

# Now, we join these two tables together and compute the mortality rates by group.
smoker_numbers %>%
  inner_join(smoker_numbers_dead,by = "smoker") %>% # Joins rows with the same value of "smoker"
  mutate(mort_rate = num_dead/num_people) # mutate() creates a new variable, which can be a function of the other variables in the dataframe.
```

See anything interesting?
  
What went wrong? Why are we observing that smokers have a *lower* mortality rate than
non-smokers? This contradicts the *context* surrounding this analysis, which in this case is the large body of formal and anecdotal evidence suggesting that smoking is harmful to health.

Did we make a mistake?
  
One thing we definitely did was ignore some present information. Specifically,
we also know how old the women were. How can we include this information in our
exploratory analysis? We can compute mortality rates by age:
  
```{r mort-rate-2,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
smoker_numbers_age <- femsmoke %>%
  group_by(smoker,age) %>% # Now we're grouping by smoker AND age. The rest of the code remains unchanged.
  summarize(num_people = sum(y))

smoker_numbers_age_dead <- femsmoke %>%
  filter(dead == "yes") %>%
  group_by(smoker,age) %>%
  summarize(num_dead = sum(y))

smoker_numbers_age %>%
  inner_join(smoker_numbers_age_dead,by = c("smoker","age")) %>% 
  mutate(mort_rate = num_dead/num_people)
```

Older people are more likely to die within the 20 year followup period. 
However, examining the raw counts of people in each group, we also see that 
*in these data, older people are less likely to smoke* than younger people. So
*in these data*, less smokers died, because less smokers were old, and more
old people died.

Before moving on, get some practice doing exploratory analysis with the following
exercises:
  
### Exercises

1. What is the *relative risk* of mortality---the ratio of the mortality rates---for
smoking 18-24 year olds vs non-smoking 18-24 year olds? Compute the answer manually by
reading the numbers off the above table. Then compute it using `R` by doing the
following:
  
  - Create two datasets using `filter()`: one containing smokers and one containing
non-smokers. `filter()` out only the 18-24 year olds. This gives you two datasets
each with only one row. For example, `smokers <- femsmoke %>% filter(smoker == "yes",age = "18-24")`.
- `inner_join()` the two datasets together, using `age` as the `by` variable:
  `smokers %>% inner_join(???,by = "age")`

1. *Advanced*: modify the above steps to create the following table of relative mortality rates. You should start from a cleaned up version of the mortality rate by age table:
  
  ```{r rel-mort-rate-2}
rates_by_age <- smoker_numbers_age %>%
  inner_join(smoker_numbers_age_dead,by = c("smoker","age")) %>% 
  mutate(mort_rate = num_dead/num_people) %>%
  ungroup() # The data was previously grouped, we don't want this anymore
```

Use `dplyr::select()` to remove and rename columns, see `?dplyr::select`. You
should get the following:

```{r rel-mort-rate-1,echo = FALSE}
smokers <- rates_by_age %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(smoker == "yes") %>%
  dplyr::select(age,smoker_mort_rate = mort_rate)

nonsmokers <- rates_by_age %>%
  filter(smoker == "no") %>%
  dplyr::select(age,nonsmoker_mort_rate = mort_rate)

smokers %>%
  inner_join(nonsmokers,by = "age") %>%
  mutate(relative_risk = smoker_mort_rate/nonsmoker_mort_rate)

```

## Case study: rental housing in Toronto


The RentSafeTO: Apartment Building Standards program is designed to help renters
in the city of Toronto make informed choices about where to live, and to enforce
a minimum standard of quality upon rental units within the city. With rents 
skyrocketing and home ownership not a reasonable option for most, having an
informed view of the rental market is imperative for Toronto residents. It also helps keep leaders
accountable, specifically if we focus on social and community housing buildings.

Comprehensive and fairly clean data from the program, along with specific
information, is available at https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/apartment-building-evaluation/.
Data for the following were downloaded on `2019/09/16`. 

To start your analysis, go now and download the data
and open it in a spreadsheet and have a look. Familiarize yourselves with the
variable descriptions and how the data were collected; the *documentation*. This somewhat tedious 
task is a first step of **any** data analysis, in academia, industry, government,
or wherever.

### Load the data

The data are stored in a `.csv` file, which stands for "comma-separated-values".
Storing data in a text file with a separator, usually a comma, is very common.
These are referred to as "flat files" in an industrial context, to distinguish
them from data stored in databases.

We may read the data into `R` using the `read_csv` function in the `readr` package.
The `readr` package is part of the `tidyverse` package that we used before, so if
you installed that package, you have it loaded.

```{r read-apartment-1}
# https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/apartment-building-evaluation/
# install.packages("readr")

# Read the data in. This means call the readr::read_csv() function, point it
# to where you saved the data on your computer, and then save the result to a
# variable. I am naming this variable 'apartmentdata'.
# Type ?readr::read_csv if you want to read about this function.
apartmentdata <- readr::read_csv(
  file = "data/apartment-data/toronto-apartment-building-evaluations.csv"
)
```

The message displayed is telling you that `readr::read_csv()` guessed at what
kind of data were in each column, i.e. numbers, letters, dates, etc. You should
make sure, as I have while writing, that these are what you expect. You can
get a concise view of this dataset using the `glimpse` function in the `dplyr`
package, which is automatically loaded when you load the `tidyverse`:
  
```{r apartment-data-2}
glimpse(apartmentdata)
```

That's bigger than the `smoking` data! 3,446 rental apartment buildings, each with
32 factors measured. The buliding's address and Ward number are in there, which are
helpful for characterizing neighbourhoods.

### Analysis I: what does the data look like?

As a first step, we want to get an idea of what our data "looks like". This typically means picking some interesting variables and summarizing their distributions somehow.

Which variables to pick will depend on the context. Often it will be clear which variables are important, and sometimes not.

Because you read the documentation and familiarized yourselves with the variables in the dataset, you know that there is a variable called `SCORE` which sums up the individual category scores for each building. In the context of determining building quality, this seems like an important variable to look at.

We'll summarize the distribution of `SCORE` using a five-number summary and mean, and a **histogram** with a **kernel density estimate**.

First, prepare the data for analysis:

```{r apartment-descriptive-1}
# First, select only the columns you want
# This isn't strictly necessary but trust me, it makes 
# debugging WAY easier.
# I'm also renaming the columns so the dataframe looks prettier.
# Again, trust me. This stuff matters.
apartmentclean <- apartmentdata %>% 
  filter(!is.na(SCORE)) %>% # Remove apartments with missing scores
  dplyr::select(ward = WARD,
                score = SCORE,
                property_type = PROPERTY_TYPE,
                year_built = YEAR_BUILT,
                address = SITE_ADDRESS
  )
glimpse(apartmentclean) # Much nicer!
```

To compute the five-number summary (plus mean), use the `summary()` function in `R`. I also want to know the *standard deviation* of `SCORE`:

```{r apartment-descriptive-2}
summary(apartmentclean$score)
sd(apartmentclean$score,na.rm = TRUE)
```

The worst building in the city has a total score of 37, and the best gets 99. The median score---half the buildings in the city have a lower score, and half a higher score than this---is 72, and this roughly equals the mean of 72.28. 25% of buildings score higher than 77, and 25% score lower than 68. So most buildings seem to fall within less than one standard deviation of the mean, which indicates that these data are fairly *concentrated* about their mean.

To provide some context, go look up your own building (if you live in a rental building) or that of a friend in the data. Where does your building fall in terms of quality within Toronto?

So far we have used tabular displays to summarize our data, for both the `smoking` and the apartment data. 
We also learned about graphical displays. Let's see a histogram of the scores, with a kernel density
estimate:

We can make a histogram in `R` as follows:

```{r apartment-descriptive-3}
# The ggplot2 package is loaded as part of the tidyverse
score_histogram <- apartmentclean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = score)) + # Tell ggplot to use score on the x axis
  theme_classic() + # Make the plot pretty
  geom_histogram( # Makes a histogram
    aes(y = ..density..),
    bins = 20,
    colour = "black",
    fill = "lightgrey"
  ) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of RentSafeTO Apartment Building Standards score",
       x = "Score",
       y = "Density") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(30,100,by = 5))

score_histogram
```

It appears that most buildings are in the 65 to 85 range. I actually just moved
from a building that has a 66 to a building that has an 86. The difference
is substantial!

### Analysis II: Do different wards have different quality housing?

A Ward is an administrative district within the city that has a single city 
counsellor. If I'm thinking about moving to, or within, Toronto, I want to know:
**Do different wards have different quality housing?**.

In order to address this question we need to decide on the following:

- **Variable of interest**. How do we *quantify* our research question? We need
to pick a *measure of quality*. Picking different measures can lead to different
conclusions.
- **Filters**. Do we look at all apartment buildings? Should we look only at those
built after, or before, a certain date? Only those that meet a certain minimum,
or maximum, standard of quality according to our definition? Are there any other
kinds of decisions we might have to consider?
- **Methods**. What kind of statistical tools should we use to address our research
question? We need to pick descriptive statistics to report, and decide whether 
we want to include other auxillary variables in the analysis.
- **Conclusions**. How do we report our results? Tables, charts, maps? Should we
include subjective, editorial commentary, or let the data speak for
themselves?

This is already overwhelming! Let's make an attempt at it. I propose:
  
- Our **variable of interest** should be `SCORE`, which you know (because you
read the documentation...) is the "overall score of the buliding". Higher is 
better. The actual formula is included in the documentation of the data.
- We will **filter** the data to only include buildings where `PROPERTY_TYPE == 'PRIVATE'`,
which will restrict our analysis to not include social housing. The quality of social
housing is an important social justice issue (that you will investigate in the exercises)
but it's somewhat separate (?) from the question of where to look for rental housing.
- Our **methods** will include looking at a table of average scores for each ward.
We will also look at whether older or newer buildings receive better scores. 
- We will summarize our **conclusions** through a subjective assessment of the 
above table of average scores.

With these decisions made, we may proceed with our analysis using the `tidyverse`
as follows:

```{r apartment-analysis-1}
# Apply filter(s).
apartmentfiltered <- apartmentclean %>%
  filter(property_type == "PRIVATE")
# When filtering, always compare the filtered and unfiltered data to ensure
# the result is as expected:
glimpse(apartmentclean)
glimpse(apartmentfiltered)
nrow(apartmentclean) - nrow(apartmentfiltered) # Dropped 567 rows.

# Now create the table of averages:
apartmentfiltered %>%
  group_by(ward) %>%
  summarize(avg_score = mean(score))

```

Bah! What happened? Why are there these `NA` values? 
  
  `NA` is the value `R` uses to mean "missing". We have to hope that whether a 
rental apartment building's `score` is missing *is not related* to what that score *is*,
that is, we hope apartments with higher or lower scores aren't missing more often.

We will ignore missingness for now. To do this, use the `na.rm = TRUE` option in
`mean`:

```{r apartment-analysis-2}
apartmentsummary <- apartmentfiltered %>%
  group_by(ward) %>%
  summarize(avg_score = mean(score,na.rm = TRUE))
apartmentsummary
```

This isn't a super friendly way of comparing these 26 numbers. I'd rather use a
graphical display, like the boxplots we learned about in chapters 15 and 16:

```{r barchart-apartment-1}
apartmentfiltered %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ward,y = score)) + 
  theme_classic() +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "ABS score shows moderate variability across wards in Toronto",
       x = "Ward",
       y = "ABS Score") 
```

It looks like some wards are better than others. Or are they? Can we make any
definitive conclusions based on this?

### Analysis III: trends in quality over time

Let's go further and analyze some other interesting aspects of these data. I'm
interested in knowing: **Are newer buildings higher quality**? 

We have the `score`
and the `year_built`, and we'd like to investigate whether newer buildings (higher
`year_built`) have higher `scores`. We have another decision to make. We could
consider `year_built` to be a categorical variable, and make a bar chart. Or, 
we could consider it to be a continuous variable.

Because values of `year_built` are inherently comparable, and because *our research
question involves making such comparisons*, we will consider `year_built` to be
a continuous variable.

One type of plot used to compare continuous variables is a **scatterplot**. A 
scatterplot has continuous variables on the x- and y-axes, and draws a point (or
bubble) at each place in the two-dimensional plane where a datapoint occurs. We
can make this kind of plot in `ggplot2` as well. This time, we use the raw 
(well, cleaned and filtered) data:

```{r apartment-plot-2}
apartmentfiltered %>%
  filter(year_built > 1900) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year_built,y = score)) +
  theme_classic() + 
  geom_point(pch = 21,colour = "black",fill = "grey") + # pch=21 makes the bubbles hollow, looks nice
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1900,2020,by=10)) + # Set the x-axis range
  labs(title = "Less rental buildings are being built recently, but they are of higher quality",
       x = "Year Built",
       y = "ABS Score")
```

Very interesting. You can clearly see the baby boom of the 1950's to 1970's, followed by a massive slowdown in construction during the economic slump in the 1980's, and a complete stop when rent control was introduced in 1991 (remember, these are *rental* buildings only). Then, we see a new wave of
rental building construction, and the new buildings seem to be of higher quality.

What are the highest and lowest quality rental buildings in Toronto?

```{r apartment-3}
# Get the 10 highest scoring buildings
apartmentfiltered %>%
  arrange(desc(score)) %>% # Sort the data, descending, by score
  slice(1:10) # Take the first ten- i.e. the top ten
```

Wow. I know where I want to live.

### Summary

We have seen how even something simple like trying to figure out whether
different areas of the city have different quality housing can require
a lot of decision making. And these decisions require expertise. By taking
a principled approach to learning **data analysis**, you are *empowering*
yourself to live a life that is better informed.

But notice that we didn't really answer any questions in this chapter. We
saw some rough patterns, but were they real? If we made different decisions, or if we *sampled different data*, would we have seen different patterns?

In order to understand what the problem is and how to approach it, we
need to take a more detailed look at the concept of **error**. 

### Exercises

1. Take each of the analyses we have performed on the Toronto rental data and say whether you think it's **descriptive**, **exploratory**, or **prescriptive**, or a mix, and say why.

1. What is that "YY" ward that shows up in the dot plot? Investigate this unusual observation. 

1. Read the documentation online and choose three variables that you find the most interesting. Reproduce the analyses I, II and III using your variables. Is there more or less variability across wards than with `score`?

1. What is the ward with the highest average score? In what ward is/are the building(s) with the highest score(s)? Is this the same ward, or not? Would you expect the ward with the highest average to also have the highest-scoring buildings? Repeat this question with the lowest scoring buildings instead of the highest.

1. If you live in a rental apartment, find it in these data. If not, find a friend's place. How does your building compare to other buildings in your ward? Does it score higher or lower? The `filter()` function is your friend here, or you can use `apartmentfiltered %>% arrange(SITE_ADDRESS) %>% print(n = Inf)` and then find yours in the list manually.

1. Combine the analyses of sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3. with that of 2.3.4. Specifically, make a table and a boxplot of the average score by year. This means replace `ward` by `year_built` in the analysis of sections 2.3.2. and 2.3.3. Do your conclusions change when comparing with 2.3.4? Why or why not? Would you expect this to always be the case?

1. *Advanced*: analyze the quality of **social housing** in Toronto. Perform a similar analysis to what we performed here for `PROPERTY_TYPE == 'PRIVATE'`, but instead for `PROPERTY_TYPE %in% c('SOCIAL HOUSING','TCHC')` (equivalent to `PROPERTY_TYPE != 'PRIVATE'`). Does the quality of social housing in Toronto vary greatly across different wards? Is it improving or degrading over time? Do you think we have enough information here to definitively answer these questions?
